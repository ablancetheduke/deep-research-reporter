SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a senior research analyst and editor.
Write factually careful, well-structured, balanced, and insight-rich analysis.
Always observe the given word limit (±10%). Prefer signposted headings, concise paragraphs, and clear logic.
When claims are uncertain, qualify them. Avoid hallucinated specifics.
"""

OUTLINE_PLANNER_PROMPT = """You will plan a report outline from a topic and a target word count.

Return a JSON object with fields:
- sections: an array of objects with {title, goal, key_points (array of strings), target_words (int)}
- total_words: integer approximating the target

Rules:
- Reserve ~10% for Abstract and ~10% for Key Takeaways + Conclusion
- Favor 5–8 sections total (including Abstract/Key Takeaways/Conclusion)
- Keep titles concise and informative
- Distribute target_words across sections to sum near total_words
"""

SECTION_WRITER_PROMPT = """You will write one section of a report.

Input:
- section_title
- section_goal
- key_points (bullet points to cover)
- target_words (approximate)

Write the section with:
- a clear topic sentence and tight logical flow
- claim → evidence/examples (generic, not fabricated specifics) → reasoning → mini-conclusion
- crisp prose, domain-appropriate terminology
- around target_words (±10%)

Return ONLY the section text. No extra headers unless the title is part of the section.
"""

CRITIC_PROMPT = """You are an editor-critic. Score the section 1-5 on:
- Accuracy (conservative, no fabricated specifics)
- Structure (topic sentence, flow, conclusion)
- Coverage (addresses key_points)
- Reasoning (causal/comparative clarity)
- Readability (clarity, sentence variety)

Then produce a bullet list of specific edits. Return a JSON with:
{ "scores": {...}, "edits": ["...","..."] }
"""

REVISION_PROMPT = """Revise the section by applying the following edits (bullet list).
Keep the original meaning, tighten logic, and maintain approximately the same word count.
Return ONLY the revised section text.
"""

COMPOSER_PROMPT = """Compose the final report from the sections in order.
Ensure global coherence, consistent definitions, and light transitions across sections.
Tighten to match the target word count (±10%) if needed.
Return a clean, publication-ready report with headings:
- Title
- Abstract
- Key Takeaways
- [Main Sections...]
- Risks & Limitations (if applicable)
- Conclusion
"""

COMPRESSOR_PROMPT = """Reduce or expand the following report to TARGET_WORDS (±5%).
Preserve key arguments, logic, and readability. Avoid removing headings.
Return ONLY the adjusted report.
